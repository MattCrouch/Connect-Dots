# Connect Dots
**Connect Dots** is a simple JS powered Canvas that connects a few dots together, based on which is closest. 

It was originally intended to form part of my [site's](http://www.mattcrouch.net) header, but it looked too busy so I took it out.

The main idea behind Connect Dots was to dip a toe back in Canvas creation. It's nothing special, but at least it's somewhat pretty to look at.
